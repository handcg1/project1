        <h1> Project 1 - Report</h1>
        <ol>
            <li> I built a portfolio / resume website for my client John Hand who is also my brother. </li>

            <li> All the information on my website comes from my client, John Hand. The images used were either provided by John, taken from articles he has written, or taken from a royalty / license free photo source. 
                The images on the Articles and Podcast pages are taken from articles that John has written or podcasts John has produced. All of these images include credit to the photographer. 
                One of the articles did not have an image so I used a picture from Pexels, a site that provides license free photos though I still gave credit to the website and photographer under the image.
            </li>
            <li> My website contains 6 different pages: About John, Contact, Resume, Articles, Podcasts and Videos</li>

            <li> Each page on my website has its own header at the top of the page except for the about page which has a header in the middle of the page. 
                All the headers are styled the same way and there specific css properties can be found in a shared css file called 'btn-header'
            </li>

            <li> 
                Each page on my website has a navigation bar at the very top of the page with links to the other pages. 
                The navigation bar has a consistent style across all pages and its css style sheet can be found inside a shared css file called 'nav'.
            </li>

            <li> To accomidate for mobile development, the navigation links at the top of every page turn into a hamburger bar. 
                Additionally, for smaller displays images and video take up the entire width of the screen on pages such as articles, podcasts and videos. 
            </li>

            <li> My website uses the same color pallete across all pages. 
                Additionally, all buttons, headers and navigation elements are styled the same throughout the website.
                These elements can be found in their own style sheets shared between all pages. 
                The rest of the styling for each page is in it's own stylesheet that corresponds to the page's name.
            </li>
            <li>
                Each page has the same favicon which is John Hand's initals in white font with a red background.
            </li>
            <li>
                All my images are in an images folder and each image is name corresponds to the article or podcast number that it corresponds to. 
                All css files are in a css folder and all javascript files are in a folder called js. 
            </li>
            <li>
                The website has no third party frameworks. All the css, html and javascript was written by myself.
            </li>
            <li> 
                I have checked each html and css file on W3C's Nu Validator and have received no errors or warnings.
            </li>

            <li> 
                I favored left aligned text. 
            </li>

            <li>
                I used a combination of sans serif and serfi font throughout my website with heading in sans serif and paragraphs or text in serif.
                Additionally, all my headers are in Montserrat Alternates font. 
            </li>
            <li> 
                My form can be found on the Contact page. It is a simple form that asks for the user to write a subject and message. 
                Upon clicking the submit button a javascript function is called that opens up the users email application and fills in the subject and body of the email with the input from the form.
            </li>
            <li> 
                In the navigation bar there are links to Twitter and Linkedin. Additionally, the articles page and podcast page both include links to the external sites that have the articles and podcast that John has written or made.
            </li>
            <li> meaningful names / consistent formatting? -> auto formatter </li>

            <li> My Github repository can be found at <a href="https://github.com/handcg1/project1">https://github.com/handcg1/project1</a></li>

            <li> My site has the domain name of callanhand.me and can be accessed at <a href="https://project1.callanhand.me">https://project1.callanhand.me</a></li>
            
            <li> If you click this link, <a href="http://project1.callanhand.me">http://project1.callanhand.me</a> you will be redirected to port 443 </li>

            <li> I've been committing to Github throughout the entire project. My first commit was on September 21st and I have been committing multiple times each week since. </li>
