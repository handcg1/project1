    <h1> Project 1 - Report</h1>
    <ol>
        <li> I built a portfolio / resume website for my client John Hand who is also my brother. </li>

        <li> All the information on my website comes from my client, John Hand. The images used were either provided by
            John, taken from articles he has written, or taken from a royalty / license free photo source.
            The images on the Articles and Podcasts pages are taken from articles that John has written or podcasts John
            has produced.
            I have also given credit to the photographer for each of these images.
            One of the articles did not have an image so I used a picture from Pexels, a site that provides license free
            photos and I still gave credit to the website and photographer under the image.
        </li>
        <li> My website contains 6 different pages: About John, Contact, Resume, Articles, Podcasts and Videos.
            The About John page is named index.html and it is the first page that comes up when you open the website.
        </li>

        <li> Each page on my website has its own header at the top of the page except for the About John page which has
            a header in the middle of the page.
            All the headers are styled the same way and their css properties can be found in a shared css file called
            'btn-header'.
        </li>

        <li>
            Each page on my website has a navigation bar at the very top of the page with links to the other pages.
            The navigation bar has a consistent style across all pages and its css style sheet can be found inside a
            shared css file called 'nav'.
        </li>

        <li> To accommodate for mobile development, the navigation links at the top of every page turn into a hamburger
            bar.
            Additionally, for smaller displays images and videos take up the entire width of the screen.
        </li>

        <li> My website uses the same color pallete across all pages.
            Additionally, all buttons, headers and navigation elements are styled the same throughout the website.
            These elements have their own style sheets shared between all pages.
            The rest of the styling for each page has it's own stylesheet that corresponds to the page's name.
        </li>
        <li>
            All images included on my website have meaningful and descriptive alt tags.
        </li>
        <li>
            Each page has the same favicon which is John Hand's initals in a white font with a red background.
        </li>
        <li>
            All my images are in an images folder and each image's name corresponds to the article or podcast number
            that it belongs to.
            All css files are in a css folder and all javascript files are in a folder called js.
        </li>
        <li>
            My website is not built with any libraries or frameworks. All the css, html and javascript was written by
            myself.
        </li>
        <li>
            I have checked each html and css file on W3C's Nu Validator and have received no errors or warnings.
        </li>

        <li>
            The content on my website is neatly aligned and favors left alignement with selective centering alignment
            used on headers.
        </li>

        <li>
            I used a combination of sans serif and serif font throughout my website.
            Additionally, all my headers are in Montserrat Alternates font and paragraph text is in the defualt html
            font.
        </li>
        <li>
            The form I created can be found on the Contact page. It is a simple form that asks for the user to write a
            subject and message.
            Upon clicking the submit button a javascript function is called that opens up the users email application
            and fills in the subject and body of the email with the input from the form.
        </li>
        <li>
            In the navigation bar there are links to Twitter and Linkedin. Additionally, the Articles and Podcasts page
            both include links to the external sites that have the articles and podcast that John has written or made.
        </li>
        <li> I used meaningful ID's and class names and used the auto formatting feature in visual studio code to have
            consistent formatting throughout all my code. </li>

        <li> I created an animation powered by CSS that can be found on the desktop display of the Videos page. </li>

        <li> My Github repository can be found at <a
                href="https://github.com/handcg1/project1">https://github.com/handcg1/project1</a></li>

        <li> All file names are lowercase and contain only letters and numbers.</li>

        <li> My site has the domain name of callanhand.me and can be accessed at <a
                href="https://project1.callanhand.me">https://project1.callanhand.me</a></li>

        <li> I've been committing to Github throughout the entire project. My first commit was on September 21st and I
            have been committing multiple times each week since. </li>
