        <h1> Callan Hand Report</h1>
        <ol>
            <li> My website is built for a client that is not myself </li>
            <li> Any images I used were provided to me by my brother or taken from Google images 
                and the appropriate license was given.
            </li>
            <li> My website contains 6 different pages, About John, Contact, Resume, Articles, Podcasts and Videos</li>
            <li> The header for my website is my navigation links which are visible on every page.</li>
            <li> For mobile the navigation links turn into a hamburger bar. 
                Any images displayed take up the whole width on smaller displays such as the articles, podcasts and videos page. 
            </li>

            <li> My website uses the same color pallete across all pages. 
                All pages also share the same navigation css which is in its own css page. 
                Additionally, all the buttons used throughout the webpage are the same color with the same hover effect which is also in its own style sheet. 
                
            </li>
        </ol>
