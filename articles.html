                        The Millis girls' soccer team was headed into their third straight state finals. The head coach's daughter was a senior captain and his son was an assistant coach. What I found was a deeper connection between family members from the injuries Sydney Bailen, the coach's daughter, overcame in her soccer career. (Photo courtesy of Bailen Family)
